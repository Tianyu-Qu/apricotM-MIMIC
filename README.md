# APRICOT-Mamba: Acuity Prediction in Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
# Introduction
The repository contains the code implementation used for the paper APRICOT-Mamba: Acuity Prediction in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We used EHR data to make continuous predictions of patient acuity in the ICU. The repository contains the codes for all data processing, model training and validation, and post-analyses.
